<p>
If you believe that insufficient information has been provided to answer <br>
a given question, then you should write any assumptions that you think are <br>
necessary to complete the question and continue work from there. If the <br>
assumptions are reasonable, you can still obtain full marks for the question.
</p>
<p>
Note that marks are awarded primarily for working, not just for getting <br>
the correct final answer. If you get an incorrect final answer in one part<br>
of a question and use it in a later part of that question, it is still possible <br>
to achieve full marks for the later part if all working is correct.
</p>
<p>
For programming questions, you can only receive full marks for a <br>
correctly-working program that compiles with no warnings. If you simply <br>
submit the supplied file or if your program has compilation warnings/errors,<br>
then it is worth zero marks. A program that compiles but does not produce <br>
the expected result will receive partial-mark based on how close it is <br>
to being correct.
