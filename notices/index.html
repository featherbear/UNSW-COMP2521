  <h3>Prac Exam 2 information; Final Exam information; myExperience</h3>
  <p><small>Tue, 22 Jan 2019 18:49:06 +1100</small></p>
</header>
<p>Hello!
A quick reminder of what’s left in the course
in the way of assessment:</p>

<p>The second practical exam
is on <strong>Thursday, 31 January 2019</strong> at <strong>10 am</strong>.
It will consist of five questions,
both theory and practical,
which you will have 90 minutes to complete.
More information about the exam
will be released next week.</p>

<p>The final exam is
on <strong>Monday, 4 February 2019</strong> at <strong>9 am</strong>.
It will consist of ten questions,
both theory and practical,
which you will have 3 hours to complete.
More information about the exam,
including a sample final exam,
will be released by next week.</p>

<p>And, instead of us assessing you,
you can assess us:
myExperience is
UNSW’s course and teaching
evaluation and improvement scheme.
I encourage you to fill out: <strong><a href="https://myexperience.unsw.edu.au/">myExperience.unsw.edu.au</a></strong> .
Responses are anonymous,
and we won’t get to see them
until after your marks are submitted.
I’d love to know what you all thought of the course!</p>

  <h3>The Hunt is released!</h3>
  <p><small>Tue, 22 Jan 2019 18:26:01 +1100</small></p>
</header>
<p>Dracula is unleashed!
The hunts are starting tonight!</p>

<p>We’ve got some test rounds
that are running over the next day or so.
There’s only three submissions…
so there might be something
interesting to see in tonight’s round.
The link in the sidebar to
<a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2521ass/19T0.dracula/">The Hunt</a> will take
you to the hunt reports (once the hunt has run).</p>

<p>We’ll be running two rounds a day –
one at <strong><a href="https://fourtet.bandcamp.com/track/evening-side">sunset</a></strong> and one at <strong><a href="https://fourtet.bandcamp.com/track/morning-side">sunrise</a></strong> –
when we’ll get your latest submissions from Give,
and run them in the competition.
Until our views are released, it uses the view stubs.</p>

<p>Competition rounds (tentatively) start
on <strong>Wednesday evening</strong> –
but you should try to at least get
something submitted for one of the test rounds
at Tuesday sunset and Wednesday sunrise.</p>

<p>To help make sure your submissions compile,
we’ve got a dryrun that takes our game engine
and runs your dracula against your hunter.
To use it, run
<code class="highlighter-rouge">2521 dryrun assign2hunt Makefile [your .c and .h files]</code>.
Try not to break your Makefile; we rely on it working.</p>

  <h3>Census date; prac exam 1 results; Fury of Dracula groups</h3>
  <p><small>Sun, 13 Jan 2019 18:22:12 +1100</small></p>
</header>
<p>Hello! Firstly: if you’ve emailed me or asked a question on the forum in
the last week or so, and haven’t gotten a response, my apologies; I’m
working through the backlog now.</p>

<p>Census date for summer session is today: this is your last chance to
drop the course without financial or academic penalty. If you found the
first prac exam challenging, the first assignment painful, or you’re
feeling you’re not keeping up with the course, I’d suggest considering
this.</p>

<p>Prac exam 1 is now marked. Here’s the overall results:</p>

<ul>
  <li>prac1_q1: average 7.23/10; 49/103 got full marks.</li>
  <li>prac1_q2: average 7.28/10; 47/103 got full marks.</li>
  <li>prac1_q3: average 6.51/10; 35/108 got full marks.</li>
  <li>prac1_q4: average 7.09/10; 30/100 got full marks.</li>
  <li>prac1_q5: average 4.97/10; 14/84 got full marks.</li>
  <li>prac1: average 30.79/50; 64/108 got &gt;50%; 7/108 got full marks.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve now fetched WebCMS3 groups for assignment 2.  On the grades page,
you should see a field ‘ass2_group’; if you see a group ID in that
field, your group is correctly set up.  If you don’t see a group ID
there, you should fix up your group:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you haven’t yet formed an assignment 2 group –
that’s around a third of you – you should do so soon!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You should have a group of two.
If you’re in a group of three
that hasn’t yet been ok’d by your tutor,
you should either get in touch with your tutor,
or form a group of two.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure you’re in a WebCMS 3 group of type “Assignment 2”,
and make sure it’s set to private.
There’s a few groups which aren’t private,
or where only one person is in the group.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve been annoyed enough by people about tutorial changes that I’ve
relaxed the hard requirement about the same tutorial.  I’ll be dealing
with the tutorial change requests in the next day or so.

  <h3>Classes resume; public holiday tutorials rescheduled</h3>
  <p><small>Wed, 02 Jan 2019 00:59:46 +1100</small></p>
</header>
<p>Hello, and happy new year! Classes resume on Wednesday 2 January.</p>

<p>If you had a class on Monday or Tuesday, you can visit one of the
scheduled make-up tutorials for your class:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mon10 (Hayden, Cliff): Wednesday 2pm-5pm, kora</li>
  <li>mon14 (Hayden, Kristian): Friday 2pm-5pm, kora</li>
  <li>tue10 (Deep, Liz): Thursday 2pm-5pm, kora</li>
  <li>tue17 (Gal, Deep): Friday 10am-1pm, kora</li>
</ul>

<p>… or attend any other tutorial, but let the tutor know.</p>

<p>You should pay some attention to forming a group for assignment 2, which
will be released this week. Note that you cannot work by yourself
(unless you have a <em>really</em> good reason), and you cannot form a group
across tutorial classes (for gruesome technical reasons).</p>

  <h3>Teaching Recess and UNSW shutdown</h3>
  <p><small>Fri, 14 Dec 2018 21:44:16 +1100</small></p>
</header>
<p>Hello!
As of this evening,
summer teaching has paused
for your last-ever mid-session break.
There are no classes next week,
though labs should be open
if you want to work on-campus.</p>

<p>The university shuts down on
<strong>Wednesday 19 December 2018 at 5pm</strong>.
From midday on the 19th,
some parts of campus will have restricted access.
To the best of my knowledge,
CSE servers and services will remain available
during the shutdown,
but services may be unavailable
during some of this time.</p>

<p>I’m overseas for the break.
I’ll be reachable by email,
but don’t expect rapid responses.</p>

<p>The university reopens on
<strong>Wednesday 2 January 2019</strong>.
Classes resume then;
our next lecture is on Thursday 3 January.</p>

<p>Have a safe and restful holiday,
and we’ll see you next year!  <em>~j</em></p>

  <h3>Assignment 1 and lab 3 extended</h3>
  <p><small>Tue, 11 Dec 2018 18:23:32 +1100</small></p>

<p>Assignment 1 is now due
<strong>Sunday 16 December 2018 23:59</strong>
… but note that this date is
within the university shutdown period,
so don’t rely on things working.
I won’t be extending this date again,
and I won’t be extending this date
for the reason of supplementary examinations.</p>

<p>Lab 3 is now due
<strong>Sunday 6 January 2019 23:59</strong>,
as will be lab 4.</p>

<p>(Assignment 2 will be released in week 4.
It will be in pairs within your tutorial class
… you might like to find someone to work with
sooner rather than later.)</p>

  <h3>`3c +leak' fixed; assignment 1 white-box tests</h3>
  <p><small>Fri, 07 Dec 2018 22:04:46 +1100</small></p>
</header>
<p>Hello!
Thanks to everyone
who provided me useful information
to track down the bug in `3c +leak’;
it’s now fixed.
(The <em>calloc(3)</em> implementation
correctly multiplied
the size and count arguments,
but inadvertently didn’t use the result.
Oops.)
As before, please let me know
if you run into any problems
with the leak checker.</p>

<p>Also, thanks to everyone
who’s been prodding me about
white-box testing assignment 1.
As promised, I’ve added a prototype
to <em>textbuffer.h</em> to allow you
to invoke your white-box tests
from your <em>test_textbuffer.c</em> –</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cm">/**
 * Run white-box tests for this particular implementation.
 */</span>
<span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">white_box_tests</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">void</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So long as you haven’t broken the link
to the provided <em>textbuffer.h</em>,
you may have already seen these changes.
Otherwise, you should <a href="https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2521/19T0/assignments/textbuffer/files.ln/textbuffer.h">grab a fresh copy</a>.</p>

  <h3>Assignment 1 update; consults</h3>
  <p><small>Mon, 03 Dec 2018 11:06:14 +1100</small></p>
</header>
<p>Hello!
In the lecture on Tuesday,
I’ll give some pointers about
how to begin assignment 1,
if you’ve not already done so,
especially for the string manipulation code.
In addition,
a few bugs crawled out of the spec,1
which have meant I’ve needed
to change the header file a bit:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">textbuffer_search</code> now returns
type <code class="highlighter-rouge">ssize_t</code>, not <code class="highlighter-rouge">size_t</code>,
so you can indicate search failures with -1; and</li>
  <li>all use of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">const Textbuffer</code> type
have changed to just <code class="highlighter-rouge">Textbuffer</code>;
you should update your prototypes and signatures.</li>
</ul>

<p>So long as you haven’t broken the link
to the provided <em>textbuffer.h</em>,
you may have already seen these changes
and potentially compiler errors
due to type mismatches
as a result of the second change.</p>

<p>My consultations/help sessions start this week,
on Monday (today!) and Thursday from 4 to 6.</p>

  <h3>Assignment 1 released!</h3>
  <p><small>Fri, 30 Nov 2018 15:02:23 +1100</small></p>
</header>
<p>Hello!
In case you haven’t seen it yet,
<a href="https://webcms3.cse.unsw.edu.au/COMP2521/19T0/resources/21702">assignment 1 is available</a>.
It’ll be due Friday 14 December,
but I strongly recommend starting
sooner rather than later.
Some simple submission tests
will be available in the next day or so.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong>
Lecture recordings are
(or, at least, should be)
now available;
a direct link to Echo360
is in the sidebar.
You’ll need to go there via Moodle (ugh)
at least once so Echo360 knows
you’re associated with the course.
Let me know if you’re having trouble accessing them.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong>
A few people have gotten in touch
about swapping tutorial classes.
I understand it’s possible to do this yourself
via myUNSW at the moment;
but please let your old and new tutors know
if you’re going to do so.</p>
