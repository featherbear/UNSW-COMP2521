<h3>Question 3 <span class='tiny'>(17 marks)</span></h3>
<p>
In the <tt>q3</tt> directory is an implementation of a simple non-directed
and non-weighted <tt>Graph</tt> ADT, along with a main program to test it.
The ADT contains functions to create, build, remove and display graphs.
Graphs are represented using an adjacency matrix, and each edge appears
twice in the matrix (both <span class="math">(v,w)</span> and <span class="math">(w,v)</span>).
Vertices are simply integer values in the range 0..<span class="math">N-1</span>,
where <span class="math">N</span> is the number of vertices.
</p>
<p>
When graphs are used to represent networks such as the Web, it is often
important to know which vertices are connected to many other vertices.
We will call such vertices "well-connected". In our context (of quite
small graphs), a vertex is <em>well-connected</em> if it has
<i>edges to at least two other vertices</i>.
<p>
<p>
The <tt>Graph</tt> ADT contains an incomplete function to generate
an ordered sequence of well-connected vertices in a graph:
</p>
<pre>
Connects *wellConnected(Graph g, int *n)
</pre>
<p>
Your task for this question is to complete the implementation of the
<tt>wellConnected()</tt> function.
This function takes a graph and a pointer <tt>n</tt> to an integer variable,
computes a sequence of well-connected vertices, and sets <tt>*n</tt> to
a count of the number of well-connected vertices.
The sequence consists of pairs <span class="math">(vertex,#conns)</span>,
where <span class="math">#conns</span> is a count of the edges incident
on the <span class="math">vertex</span>.
The sequence is arranged in descending of the <span class="math">#conns</span>
values; where multiple vertices have the same <span class="math">#conns</span>,
the pairs are arranged in ascending order of the vertices.
The pairs are implemented as an array of <tt>Connects</tt> structures;
<tt>Connects</tt> is defined in <tt>Graph.h</tt>.
You can see examples of what these sequences look like in the expected output
files under the <tt>tests</tt> directory.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>main()</tt> function (in <tt>main.c</tt>), builds a graph, then
displays details of the graph, and then computes and displays the sequence
of well-connected vertices.
The graph data is read from the <tt><i>X</i>.in</tt> files in the <tt>tests</tt>
directory.
If you want a better idea of what the <tt>wellConnected()</tt> function produces,
look at how its results are used in the <tt>main()</tt> function.
Note that, as supplied, the <tt>wellConnected()</tt> function always says that
there are zero well-connected vertices and the main program prints an appropriate
message based on this.
</p>
<p>
The <tt>q3</tt> directory itself contains the following:
<ul>
<li> <tt>Makefile</tt> ... handles compilation and testing
<li> <tt>Graph.h</tt> ... interface to the <tt>Graph</tt> ADT
<li> <tt>Graph.c</tt> ... implementation of the <tt>Graph</tt> ADT
<li> <tt>main.c</tt> ... main program, used to produce an executable called <tt>q3</tt>
<li> <tt>tests/</tt> ... a directory containing test scripts, input files and expected outputs
</ul>
<p>
You compile and test the <tt>q3</tt> program using the following commands:
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>make q3</b>   <span class="comment"># build the q3 program</span>
$ <b>check q3</b>  <span class="comment"># apply the tests in the tests directory to the q3 program</span>
</pre>
<p>
You can find out more about the behaviour of the <tt>q3</tt> program
by looking at the files in the <tt>tests</tt> directory. The files
named <tt>t<i>X</i></tt> are test scripts. Each test script has a
corresponding file <tt>t<i>X</i>.exp</tt> which contains the expected
output from running that test.
If you want to run the tests individually, use commands like:
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>sh tests/t1</b>
</pre>
<p>
You can add debugging code to <tt>main.c</tt> or <tt>Graph.c</tt>
but make sure that you remove it before testing and submitting,
otherwise your output won't match the expected output and you'll fail all
of the tests.
You can add any auxiliary functions to <tt>Graph.c</tt>
that you think are necessary.
</p>
<p>
Once you are satisfied with your program, submit it using the command:
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>submit q3</b>
</pre>
<p>
This will make a copy of the <tt>Graph.c</tt> file from the <tt>q3</tt>
directory as your answer for this question.
You can run the <tt>submit</tt> command as many times as you like,
but make sure that your final submission compiles without any errors
or warnings.
Test your program thoroughly, possibly using test cases additional
to those supplied. Your program will be tested using inputs which
are different to the examples in the <tt>q3/tests</tt> directory.
