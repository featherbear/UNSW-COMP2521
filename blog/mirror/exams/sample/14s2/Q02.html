<h3>Question 2 <span class='tiny'>(15 marks)</span></h3>
<p>
In the <tt>q2</tt> directory is an implementation of a simple <tt>HashTable</tt> ADT,
along with a main program to test it.
The ADT contains functions to build, remove and display hash tables, as well as a
function to insert new keys into the table (in this table, keys are integer values).
It uses collision resolution via chaining (i.e. it builds linked lists of keys that
have the same hash value).
The <tt>HashTable</tt> ADT implements its chains using a simple <tt>List</tt> ADT.
It also has a private (and very simple) hash function, and an incomplete function
to expand the size of the table, once the chains become too long.
</p>
<p>
As supplied, the program creates a hash table with 3 slots, reads numbers (keys)
from standard input and builds a hash table using these keys.
The hash table maintains its original 3 slots, regardless of how many keys are
added, and the chains will grow longer and longer as more keys are added, e.g.
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>seq 1 15 | ./q2</b>   <span class="comment"># with q2 as supplied</span>
[ 0] 3->6->9->12->15
[ 1] 1->4->7->10->13
[ 2] 2->5->8->11->14
</pre>
<p>
In the output from the program, the hash table is displayed one slot at a time,
first showing the slot index (aka hash value) in square brackets (e.g. <tt>[&nbsp;0]</tt>)
then showing all of the keys in the chain associated with that hash value.
Since the hash function is implemented simply as <tt>(key%nslots)</tt>,
the above shows all of the keys with hash(key)==0 on the first line of output,
all of the keys with hash(key)==1 on the second line of output, and so on.
</p>
<p>
Your task for this question is to implement the <tt>expand()</tt> function, which
takes a hash table, doubles the number of slots in the table and rehashes all of
the existing keys to their new slots (chains).
You can achieve this however you like, but the pointer to the <tt>HashTable</tt>
object must not be changed (i.e. you keep the same <tt>HashTable</tt> object but
change what's stored in it and linked from it).
Also, you are not allowed to change the <tt>List</tt> ADT to achieve this
(since you only submit <tt>HashTable.c</tt>, changing <tt>List.c</tt> won't
help your submission) and you may only access the chains via the interface
given in <tt>List.h</tt>. (Hint: <tt>valuesFromList()</tt> is useful).
</p>
<p>
After you implement the <tt>expand()</tt> function correctly, the hash table
will have more slots, but the chains will be shorter and searches will be
more efficient, e.g.
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>seq 1 15 | ./q2</b>   <span class="comment"># with q2 including expand()</span>
[ 0] 12
[ 1] 1->13
[ 2] 2->14
[ 3] 3->15
[ 4] 4
[ 5] 5
[ 6] 6
[ 7] 7
[ 8] 8
[ 9] 9
[10] 10
[11] 11
</pre>
<p>
The <tt>q2</tt> directory contains the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>Makefile</tt> ... handles compilation and testing
<li> <tt>HashTable.h</tt> ... interface to the <tt>HashTable</tt> ADT
<li> <tt>HashTable.c</tt> ... implementation of the <tt>HashTable</tt> ADT
<li> <tt>List.h</tt> ... interface to the <tt>List</tt> ADT
<li> <tt>List.c</tt> ... implementation of the <tt>List</tt> ADT
<li> <tt>main.c</tt> ... main program, used to produce an executable called <tt>q2</tt>
<li> <tt>tests/</tt> ... a directory containing test scripts and expected outputs
</ul>
<p>
The <tt>Makefile</tt> compiles the <tt>List</tt> and <tt>HashTable</tt> ADTs
and the main program
in <tt>main.c</tt> to produce an executable program called <tt>q2</tt>.
This program reads integer keys from standard input, builds a hash table,
and then displays the hash table (in the format shown above).
</p>
<p>
You compile and test the <tt>q2</tt> program using the following commands:
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>make q2</b>   <span class="comment"># build the q2 program</span>
$ <b>check q2</b>  <span class="comment"># apply the tests in the tests directory to the q2 program</span>
</pre>
<p>
You can find out more about the behaviour of the <tt>q2</tt> program
by looking at the files in the <tt>tests</tt> directory. The files
named <tt>t<i>X</i></tt> are test scripts. Each test script has a
corresponding file <tt>t<i>X</i>.exp</tt> which contains the expected
output from running that test.
If you want to run the tests individually, use commands like:
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>sh tests/t1</b>
</pre>
<p>
You can add debugging code to <tt>main.c</tt>, <tt>HashTable.c</tt> or
<tt>List.c</tt> if you want, but make sure that you remove it before
testing and submitting,
otherwise your output won't match the expected output and you'll fail all
of the tests.
You can add any auxiliary functions to <tt>HashTable.c</tt>
that you think are necessary.
</p>
<p>
Once you are satisfied with your program, submit it using the command:
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>submit q2</b>
</pre>
<p>
This will make a copy of the <tt>HashTable.c</tt> file from the <tt>q2</tt>
directory as your answer for this question.
You can run the <tt>submit</tt> command as many times as you like,
but make sure that your final submission compiles without any errors
or warnings.
Test your program thoroughly, possibly using test cases additional
to those supplied. Your program will be tested using additional test
cases to the examples in the <tt>q2/tests</tt> directory.
