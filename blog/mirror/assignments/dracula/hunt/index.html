<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>

<ul>
  <li>to give you experience in implementing Graph-based ADTs</li>
  <li>to give you practice in implementing a heuristic game strategy</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>The aim for this part of the Assignment is to write AIs that can play
the “Fury of Dracula” game. The interface for the AIs is very simple:
the Game Engine invokes the AI, giving it an appropriate <em>View</em>, waits
for a certain amount of time while the AI thinks about its move
(possibly suggesting several moves), and then takes the last move
suggested by the AI. The Game Engine then takes the move, records it,
updates its own game state, and then move on to the next AI (in the
order specified in <a href="/~cs2521/19T0/assignments/dracula/rules/">the Rules</a>). The interface for your AIs
is very simple: they take a View as input, and send a new location and
a message as their output.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up">Setting Up</h2>

<p>Make a directory for working on this Assignment,
change into that directory, and run the command:</p>

<pre>
<kbd is="shell">2521 fetch assign2hunt</kbd>
</pre>

<blockquote class="alert alert-danger">
  <h4 class="text-center">IMPORTANT NOTE</h4>

  <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">GameView</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">DraculaView</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">HunterView</code> ADTs
supplied in this package don’t actually do anything;
they’re the skeleton versions we supplied in Phase 1.
If you want to preserve your current versions of these,
copy them somewhere safe before running this command.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’re working from home,
you can download the <a href="../hunt.zip"><em>hunt.zip</em></a> file
and then work on your local machine.</p>

<p>This will extract the following files in your directory:</p>

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">Makefile</code></dt>
  <dd>a set of dependencies used to control compilation</dd>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">player.c</code></dt>

  <dd>interface to the Map/graph ADT</dd>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">map.c</code></dt>
  <dd>partial implementation of the Map ADT</dd>
</dl>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">GameView</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">DraculaView</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">HunterView</code> ADTs
supplied in this package don’t actually do anything;
they’re the skeleton versions we supplied in Phase 1.
If you want to preserve your current versions of these,
copy them somewhere safe before running this command.</p>

<p>If you have working Views
from the first part of the assignment
that you’re happy with, use them.
If you didn’t get the Views working,
or if you’d prefer to use ours:</p>

<pre>
<kbd is="shell">2521 fetch assign2huntviews</kbd>
</pre>

<p>This will provide you updated versions of
GameView, HunterView, DracView, and Map.
These views are provided as-is;
if it breaks, you get to keep the pieces.
(These were written by students of COMP1927 14s2,
but we’re pretty confident they work:
we’ve used them for a few years,
and most of the kinks have been ironed out.)</p>

<p>Note that many of above files are provided simply as a convenience, and
you can replace them with your own versions if you want. The only
interfaces that you need to honour precisely as given are those for the
AIs (i.e. <code class="highlighter-rouge">hunter.h</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">dracula.h</code>. If you plan to include other ADTs
with your code, you’ll need to add dependencies to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Makefile</code> to
ensure that they’re compiled.</p>

<p>If you run <code class="highlighter-rouge">make</code> after copying your own View ADTs into place you should
see something like the following:</p>

<pre>
<kbd is="shell">make</kbd>
2521 3c    -c -o dracula.o dracula.c
2521 3c  -DI_AM_DRACULA -c player.c -o player_dracula.o
2521 3c    -c -o dracula_view.o dracula_view.c
2521 3c    -c -o game_view.o game_view.c
2521 3c    -c -o map.o map.c
2521 3c    -c -o places.o places.c
2521 3c   dracula.o player_dracula.o dracula_view.o game_view.o map.o places.o   -o dracula
2521 3c    -c -o hunter.o hunter.c
2521 3c  -c player.c -o player_hunter.o
2521 3c    -c -o hunter_view.o hunter_view.c
2521 3c   hunter.o player_hunter.o hunter_view.o game_view.o map.o places.o   -o hunter
</pre>

<p>Ultimately, it produces two executable files:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">./dracula</code>, which contains the Dracula AI; and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">./hunter</code>, which contains the Hunter AI.
They both work similarly
(not surprising, since they come from the same source code file):
they create a View based on a pastPlays string,
they then invoke the decide-a-move function,
and finally print out the last move and message
that function produced.  For example:</p>

<pre>
<kbd is="shell">./dracula</kbd>
Move: CD, Message: Mwuhahahaha
<kbd is="shell">./hunter</kbd>
Move: TO, Message: Have we nothing Toulouse?
</pre>

<p>Note that we supply our own <code class="highlighter-rouge">player.c</code>
when we run your AIs in the tournament.
It does essentially the same thing as above,
but additionally knows how to communicate with the Game Engine,
and enforces a time limit on the AI.
You can modify the supplied <code class="highlighter-rouge">player.c</code> as much as you want.
In particular, you could change the pastPlays and messages
that are used to build the View
to test out how your AI will respond.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do">What to Do</h2>

<p>The interface you need to deal with is very simple: there are two
functions to decide the next move that a player should make:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>void decide_hunter_move (HunterView state);
void decide_dracula_move (DraculaView state);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>… along with a function to register potential moves:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>void register_best_play (char *play, player_message message);
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">register_best_play()</code> function is already written for you,
so all you need to do is implement the <code class="highlighter-rouge">decide_..._move()</code> functions,
along with any auxiliary functions and ADTs that they require.
The <code class="highlighter-rouge">play</code> is the two-letter code
for some place on the Map of Europe (e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">LO</code> for London);
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">message</code> can be any text string
up to length <code class="highlighter-rouge">MESSAGE_SIZE-1</code> chars.</p>

<p>First, think about a strategy for each kind of player
and what info is needed to use that strategy.
If that information is already provided by your existing View ADTs,
simply use them; otherwise implement new ones.
Then, use these View ADTs as a basis
for implementing the two <code class="highlighter-rouge">decide_..._move()</code> functions.
Finally, submit your work to The Hun0t.
Repeat the previous two steps
until you are satisfied with your AIs’ performance.</p>

<h2 id="the-hunt">The Hunt</h2>

<p>Periodically (at least daily),
we will run a batch of Fury of Dracula games,
using whatever AIs have been submitted
(this is what we call a “Hunt”).
These games will be monitored
and marks awarded to the participating AIs
based on (a) whether they work at all,
(b) whether they follow the rules, and
(c) how well they play the game.</p>

<p>How each session works:</p>

<ul>
  <li>we copy all submissions from the submissions directory (for <code class="highlighter-rouge">give</code>)</li>
  <li>we attempt to compile each submission, using:
    <ul>
      <li>all of your supplied files</li>
      <li>our own copies of <code class="highlighter-rouge">player.c</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">dracula.h</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">hunter.h</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">game.h</code></li>
      <li>your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Makefile</code> (modified by us to have one extra library required by our <code class="highlighter-rouge">player.c</code>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>any <code class="highlighter-rouge">./dracula</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">./hunter</code> files are saved</li>
  <li><strong>for</strong> each (<code class="highlighter-rouge">hunter</code>,<code class="highlighter-rouge">dracula</code>) pair <strong>do</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>move the <code class="highlighter-rouge">hunter</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">dracula</code> programs into the “game arena”</li>
      <li>start the Game Engine, invoke the AIs to determine moves, record game progress</li>
      <li>when the game ends (see Rules), the game progress is analysed to determine marks</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>we update tournament tables that show whose AI is performing best</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that each game uses one <code class="highlighter-rouge">./hunter</code> from one group to play all four
Hunter roles (i.e. the same AI will be used to play Lord Godalming, Dr.
Seward, Van Helsing, and Mina Harker). Also, we will ensure that your
Hunter AI always plays against a Dracula AI from another group.</p>

<p>Since the marks are based on performance in the Hunts, it’s in your best
interest to submit working AIs as soon as possible. Even submitting an
AI that simply moves to a random reachable location is worth something
(not much admittedly, but better than zero, which is what no AI or a
non-functioning AI will score). You can submit as many times as you
like; the most recent submission will be chosen for each Hunt.</p>

<p>More details on how you find out about the performance of your AIs in
the hunt will be available shortly.</p>

<!--
You can view the logs of the Hunts at the URL:

    https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs2521ass/19t0.dracula/

The `compilation_logs` directory contains
the results of attempting to make your submission.
It's only useful if your submission didn't compile.
The `logs` directory contains logs of all games in that Hunt.
The log files have names like `hSID1-dSID2.log`,
where `SID1` is the student ID of the person who submitted the hunter AI,
and `SID1` is the student ID of the person who submitted the dracula AI.
If your hunter AI compiled,
there should be roughly 20 adjacent entries
for all of the games played by your hunter
against some random draculas.
If your dracula AI compiled,
you can find any occurrences of where it was used by searching for `dSID`
where *SID* is the student ID of the person in your group who submitted it.
-->

<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>

<p>You should submit your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Makefile</code>,
along with all of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.c</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">.h</code> files
that are needed to produce your players.
This will include, at least:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Makefile</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">dracula.c</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">hunter.c</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">dracula_view.c</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">dracula_view.h</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">hunter_view.c</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">hunter_view.h</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">game_view.c</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">game_view.h</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If you change <code class="highlighter-rouge">map.h</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">map.c</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">places.h</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">places.c</code>,
you should also include those in your submission.
Also include any other ADTs that you develop
that are needed for your Views or AIs.</p>

<p>You will need to set up your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Makefile</code>
to ensure that it includes all of the appropriate files
in the dependencies and rules.
If your <code class="highlighter-rouge">Makefile</code> doesn’t work properly,
your players won’t be included in the next tournament,
even if all of the code is correct.</p>

<p>All submissions are made on behalf of the group,
no matter which member of the group makes the submission.
If several group members make submissions,
only the most recent submission will be used.</p>

<p>To submit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>log into your CSE account, via SSH or VLAB –
you <em>cannot</em> submit via the web</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>change into the directory containing all of your files</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>test your submission one of these commands:</p>

    <pre><kbd is="shell">2521 dryrun assign2hunt Makefile *.c *.h &gt; <i>SomeFile</i></kbd></pre>
    <pre><kbd is="shell">2521 dryrun assign2hunt Makefile *.c *.h | less</kbd></pre>

    <p>The above command will allow you to check that you are submitting
sufficient files to at least enable your submission to compile.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>do the submission!</p>

    <pre><kbd is="shell">2521 classrun give assign2hunt Makefile <i>*.[ch]</i></kbd></pre>
  </li>
</ul>
