<h2 id="objectives">Objectives</h2>

<ul>
  <li>to give you experience in implementing Graph-based ADTs</li>
  <li>to give you practice in implementing a well-defined interface</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>The ultimate goal for this assignment is
to write AIs that can play the “Fury of Dracula” game.
The interface for the AIs is very simple:
the Game Engine invokes the AI,
waits for a certain amount of time
while the AI thinks about its move
(possibly suggesting several moves),
and then takes the last move suggested by the AI.
The AIs clearly need to know about the game state
in order to decide on a move.
Their access to the game state is
via an appropriate View ADT:
hunters use the <em>HunterView</em> ADT,
and Dracula uses the <em>DraculaView</em> ADT.
Both of these ADTs are layered on top of
a generic <em>GameView</em> ADT.
Your task in this phase of the assignment
is to implement a version of these ADTs
that your AIs can use.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up">Setting Up</h2>

<p>Make a directory for working on this assignment,
change into that directory, and run the command:</p>

<pre>
<kbd is="shell">2521 fetch assign2view</kbd>
</pre>

<p>If you’re working from home,
you can download the <a href="../view.zip"><em>view.zip</em></a> file
and then work on your local machine.</p>

<p>This will extract the following files in your directory:</p>

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">Makefile</code></dt>
  <dd>a set of dependencies used to control compilation</dd>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">game.h</code></dt>
  <dd>definitions of Game constants; interface to game engine</dd>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">game_view.h</code></dt>
  <dd>interface to the GameView ADT</dd>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">game_view.c</code></dt>
  <dd>skeleton implementation of GameView ADT</dd>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">test_game_view.c</code></dt>
  <dd>main program containing a few tests for GameView ADT</dd>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">dracula_view.h</code></dt>

  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">dracula_view.c</code></dt>
  <dd>skeleton implementation of DraculaView ADT</dd>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">test_dracula_view.c</code></dt>
  <dd>main program containing a few tests for DraculaView ADT</dd>

  <dd>interface to the HunterView ADT</dd>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">hunter_view.c</code></dt>
  <dd>skeleton implementation of HunterView ADT</dd>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">test_hunter_view.c</code></dt>
  <dd>main program containing a few tests for HunterView ADT</dd>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">places.h</code></dt>
  <dd>interface to Places ADT</dd>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">places.c</code></dt>
  <dd>partial implementation of Places ADT</dd>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">map.h</code></dt>
  <dd>interface to Map/graph ADT</dd>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">map.c</code></dt>
  <dd>partial implementation of Map ADT</dd>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">past_plays</code></dt>
  <dd>some sample <code class="highlighter-rouge">past_plays</code> strings</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that the <em>Places</em> and <em>Map</em> ADTs
are slightly <em>modified</em> versions of
the ADTs from the Week 4 Lab.
They are very similar to,
<em>but not the same as</em>,
those ADTs;
make sure you read them carefully
before using them.
You are not required to use the <em>Map</em> ADT,
but it will probably save you some time.
You are allowed to modify it
(both <em>.h</em> and <em>.c</em> files) if you wish.</p>

<blockquote class="alert alert-danger">
  <h4 class="text-center">IMPORTANT NOTE</h4>

  <p>For this stage of the assignment,
you must implement the supplied ADT interfaces
<em>completely unchanged</em> (otherwise you’ll fail auto-testing).
However, for the next stage of the assignment
you can augment these ADTs as much as you like.
You might want to maintain two versions of each View:
one to submit for this stage of the assignment,
and the other to hold the functions
that you think would be most useful for your AI.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-gameview">What to do: <code class="highlighter-rouge">GameView</code></h2>

<p>You have two tasks for this part of the exercise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>design and build an implementation of the <em>GameView</em> ADT,</li>
  <li>write a comprehensive test suite
to ensure that the ADT is working correctly</li>
</ul>

<p>The first task requires you to complete the <code class="highlighter-rouge">game_view.c</code> file.
You should <em>not</em> modify the <code class="highlighter-rouge">game_view.h</code> file.
If you decide to use other ADTs,
these should be <code class="highlighter-rouge">#include</code>‘d in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">game_view.c</code> file,
not in <code class="highlighter-rouge">game_view.h</code>.
Read <code class="highlighter-rouge">game_view.h</code> carefully
to ensure that you understand
what each function is supposed to do.
Then, design data structures to support this,
then implement the functions
on top of these data structures.
You are free to use the supplied <em>Map</em> ADT,
and you are free to use
any other ADTs that you think will help.
Note that if you use other ADTs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>you will need to add them into the <em>Makefile</em>, and</li>
  <li>you will need to submit them.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you modify the <em>Map</em> ADT,
you will also need to submit the modified version.</p>

<p>The second task requires you
to think about all of the cases
that your <em>GameView</em> ADT needs to handle
and come up with as many tests
as you can think of
to ensure that all cases are checked.
The supplied <code class="highlighter-rouge">test_game_view.c</code> file
provides some tests,
to give an idea of what’s required,
but they are by no means comprehensive.
You should add as many
as you think are needed
to check that your ADT is working properly.
This is in your own best interests,
since, if you submit a buggy ADT to The Hunt
to support your AI,
then your AI will (by making enough invalid moves)
eventually be disqualified for that game,
and you will miss out on performance marks.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-hunterview-and-draculaview">What to do: <code class="highlighter-rouge">HunterView</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">DraculaView</code></h2>

<p>You have two tasks for this part of the exercise:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>design and build an implementation of
the <em>HunterView</em> and <em>DraculaView</em> ADTs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>write a comprehensive test suite
to ensure that both ADTs are working correctly</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <em>HunterView</em> and <em>DraculaView</em> provide
views of the game state
appropriate to either a hunter player
or the Dracula player.
They provide much the same functionality
as the <em>GameView</em> ADT,
but with some specialisations
towards the needs and/or capabilities
of the relevant players.</p>

<p>Some assumptions in the design of these ADTs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>they will be used by AIs
in their <code class="highlighter-rouge">decide_{dracula,hunter}_move</code> function</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>no AI will use the <em>GameView</em> ADT directly</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <em>HunterView</em> and <em>DraculaView</em> ADTs
should use <em>GameView</em> in their implementation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <em>DraculaView</em> ADT will only be used by the Dracula AI,
and only when it’s Dracula’s turn</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the <em>HunterView</em> ADT will be used by the Hunter AI,
and will be used for all of the Hunter players</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a Hunter AI can work out
which Hunter player it’s currently running as
by using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">hv_get_player()</code> function</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should use the same strategy for
the design, implementation and testing of
your <em>HunterView</em> and <em>DraculaView</em> ADTs,
as you used in developing your <em>GameView</em> ADT, i.e.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>read the <code><em>player</em>_view.h</code> file
to understand what each function is supposed to do,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>design a data structure
that can support the required operations
(will include a <em>GameView</em> value)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>implement each of the functions
 specified in the <code><em>player</em>_view.h</code> interface,
 using the skeleton <code><em>player</em>_view.c</code> file provided</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you may use other ADTs in implementing
either or both of the <em>playerView</em> ADTs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>these ADTs may not require much code of their own,
since they rely on most of the work being done
by the <em>GameView</em> ADT</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>once implemented, design a comprehensive set of tests,
add them to the appropriate <code>test_<em>player</em>_view.c</code> file</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>test, re-code, repeat …
maybe with the occasional stop for eat and sleep</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have implemented
and thoroughly tested all three ADTs,
move on to the submission step.</p>

<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>

<p>You should submit all your Views and tests
(and any additional ADTs) at the same time.
Only one member of each Fury of Dracula group needs to submit.</p>

<p>To submit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>ssh</em> into your CSE account (you can’t submit via the web)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>change into the directory containing all of your files</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>test your submission with this command:</p>

    <pre><kbd is="shell">2521 dryrun assign2view <em>files...</em></kbd></pre>

    <p>The above command will allow you to check
that you are submitting sufficient files
to at least enable your submission to compile.
The dryrun tests your code against the provided tests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>submit your work with this command:</p>

    <pre><kbd is="shell">give cs2521 assign2view <em>files...</em></kbd></pre>

    <p>You should also be able to submit via WebCMS.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<!--
Note: Submission/dryrun is not yet set up,
but will be available by the middle of Week XX.
-->

<p>Dryrun source code can be found in
<a href="/~cs2521/19T0/assignments/dracula/dryrun.view/">/web/cs2521/19t0/assignments/dracula/dryrun.view/</a>.</p>

<h2 id="assessment">Assessment</h2>

<p><strong>60</strong> marks are derived from automated performance testing,
where we check your implementation is complete and correct.</p>

<p><strong>20</strong> marks are subjective assessment of your code style.</p>

<p><strong>20</strong> mark is from manual and automated assessment of your tests.</p>
