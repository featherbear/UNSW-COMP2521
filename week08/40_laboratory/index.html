<h2 id="setting-up">Setting up</h2>

<p>Create a directory for this lab, change into it,
and retrieve the files with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">fetch</code> command:</p>

<pre><kbd is="shell">2521 fetch lab08</kbd></pre>

<p>Or, <a href="../files.tar">download all the files</a>.</p>

<p>Compiling with <code class="highlighter-rouge">make</code> will produce three executables:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">mkwords</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">words</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">words2</code>.
The <code class="highlighter-rouge">mkwords</code> program is fully functional,
and produces sequences of <var>N</var> words
using a random number generator with (optional) <var>Seed</var>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
<kbd is="shell">./mkwords 10 3</kbd>
allpnl
ahebpveeloatic
ualoubyy
hssaif
rywt
tiehaelsh
oheom
vmoe
jeabzsa
zqa
</pre>

<p>produces 10 “words” using a random number generator seed of 3.</p>

<p>If you want to generate really random
(<em>i.e.</em> unreproduceable) word lists,
don’t supply a seed parameter,
and <code class="highlighter-rouge">mkwords</code> will use an effectively random seed.
Note that <code class="highlighter-rouge">mkwords</code> will inevitably produce
duplicate words for any reasonable-sized <var>N</var>.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">words</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">words2</code> don’t currently work.
<code class="highlighter-rouge">words</code> reads the dictionary words into
a tree structure for fast lookup.
<code class="highlighter-rouge">words2</code> reads the dictionary words into
a Hashtable structure for fast lookup.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">rotate_left</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">rotate_right</code> in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tree.c</code> are broken.
They do not update the size information in the nodes.
This stops other functions that rely on the size field,

  Exercise 2: Balancing Trees
  <small class="text-muted text-nowrap">(1 mark)</small></h2>

<blockquote class="alert alert-danger">
  <p>You must get Exercise 1 working before you start this,
otherwise the balancing functions used in this task will not work!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should begin by looking primarily at the code in <strong><code class="highlighter-rouge">words.c</code></strong>.</p>

<h4 id="a-understanding-the-words-program">a) Understanding the <code class="highlighter-rouge">words</code> program</h4>

<p>This contains a program that reads the words in from a specified file,
loads them into a tree, and then prints statistics about the tree.</p>

<p>After inserting each word into the tree, the program immediately searches for
them, to make sure that they were actually inserted.</p>

<p>After inserting all words, it then searches for several “words” not in the
input; these should not be found in the tree.</p>

<p>The program then prints out the number of nodes and the height of
the tree used to store the words. It also prints out what kind of rebalancing
strategy was used (the different rebalancing strategies are explained below.)</p>

<p>Finally, it clears all of the memory used by the tree and exits.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="b-running-the-words-program">b) Running the <code class="highlighter-rouge">words</code> program</h4>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">words</code> program takes two command-line parameters:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The name of the file to read from</li>
  <li>An integer that represents what tree balancing strategy should be
used by the tree.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">words</code> program can also read from its standard input if the
filename is given as a single minus sign.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Make</code> the file and confirm that it runs using balance strategy 0
(No rebalancing) by running it as follows:</p>

<pre><kbd is="shell">./mkwords 10 | ./words - 0</kbd></pre>

<p>You can run other balancing strategies (once you have implemented them)
by using different command line arguments.</p>

<p>For example, once you have implemented <code class="highlighter-rouge">REBALANCE_1</code> strategy you could
also try the approach where the tree has been rebalanced after every
insertion by running:</p>

<pre><kbd is="shell">./mkwords 10 | ./words - 1</kbd></pre>

<p>To run experiments with sorted data you could do</p>

<pre><kbd is="shell">./mkwords 10 | sort | ./words - 1</kbd></pre>

<p>Or for reverse sorted data</p>

<pre><kbd is="shell">./mkwords 10 | sort -r | ./words - 1</kbd></pre>

<p>To time your experiments you could do something like</p>

<pre><kbd is="shell">./mkwords 10 | sort | time ./words - 1</kbd></pre>

<p>Note: You may want to comment out the line of code that actually draws
the tree once you start running experiments.
But is handy to use to check and understand what all the different trees
do and make sure your program is working.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="c-completing-tree_insert">c) Completing <code class="highlighter-rouge">tree_insert</code></h4>

<p>We are going to investigate/implement the following approaches for
rebalancing a BST.</p>

<ol>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">NO_REBALANCE</code>: No rebalancing - normal BST insertion</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">REBALANCE_1</code>: Global rebalancing after every insertion</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">REBALANCE_100</code>: Global rebalancing after every 100 items are inserted</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">REBALANCE_1000</code>: Global rebalancing after every 1000 items are inserted</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">RANDOMISED</code>: Using randomised BST insertion</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">SPLAY</code>: Using splay insertion</li>
</ol>

<p>Your task is to <strong>complete a function called <code class="highlighter-rouge">tree_insert</code></strong>
which is partially implemented in the file <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tree.c</code></p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="n">tree_insert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Tree</span> <span class="n">tree</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Item</span> <span class="n">it</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The function should call the appropriate <code class="highlighter-rouge">insert_recursive</code> and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">balance</code> functions according to the specified rebalancing approach.
The function already handles the first balancing strategies (not
balancing the tree at all), you need to add code to handle the rest.</p>

<p>Note: <strong>All the necessary functions</strong> for standard insertion, balancing,
random insertion and splay insertion <strong>are provided</strong>.
You just need to call them appropriately.</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="d-recording-your-results">d) Recording your results</h4>

<p>Once you have implemented the above strategies, <strong>run all approaches</strong>
 on the different sized inputs and <strong>record</strong> in a file called lab08.txt:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the heights of the resulting trees</li>
  <li>the amount of user time it takes to insert and search for all keys</li>
  <li>the amount of user time it takes to insert all keys
(comment out the line in the main function that calls the search
functions)</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>Note: Make sure you run the randomised BST approach a number of times to
get an average (as this is a randomised approach and heights will differ
‘randomly’ each time).</p>

<p>Note: Our implementation allows duplicates to be inserted into the tree,
but searching will just return the first occurrence found</p>

<hr />

<h4 id="e-discussion-questions">e) Discussion questions</h4>

<p>Discuss (in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">lab08.txt</code> file) the reasons for the differences in
height and run times between these different approaches and algorithms.</p>

<p>How does each algorithm influence the time to insert vs the time to
search vs the height of the resulting tree?</p>

<p>What other tests could you run to compare these implementations?</p>

<h2 id="exercise-3">
  Exercise 3: HashTable Implementation
  <small class="text-muted text-nowrap">(1 mark)</small></h2>

<h4 id="a-understanding-the-words2-program">a) Understanding the <code class="highlighter-rouge">words2</code> program</h4>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">words2.c</code> is a program that is similar to <code class="highlighter-rouge">words.c</code>, but instead of
using trees to store the words it stores the words in a <strong>hash table</strong>.</p>

<p>The program is run in a similar way, however this time, the second
command line argument indicates what size to make the hash table
(note: it’s best if this is a prime number).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><kbd is="shell">./mkwords 10 | ./words2 - 100</kbd></pre>

<p>reads in 10 words and stores them in a hash table of size 100.</p>

<h4 id="b-understanding-hashtablec">b) Understanding <code class="highlighter-rouge">HashTable.c</code></h4>

<p>Inside the <code class="highlighter-rouge">HashTable.c</code> file, there is an implementation of a hash table
that uses <strong>chaining</strong> to handle collisions.</p>

<p>The hash table consists of an indexed array of lists, which are based on
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">List</code> data type.</p>

<p>The core hash table functions (insert, delete, search) are all quite
simple, and consist of using the hash function to find the appropriate
list, and then carrying out the relevant operation using the appropriate
<code class="highlighter-rouge">List</code> function.</p>

<p>All of the hash table function are complete except for <code class="highlighter-rouge">hash_table_stats()</code>.</p>

<h5 id="listc"><code class="highlighter-rouge">List.c</code></h5>

<p>Other relevant code is in <code class="highlighter-rouge">List.c</code> which provides a standard
implementation of a linked list of items, which you can assume is
correct.</p>

<h5 id="itemc"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Item.c</code></h5>

<p>Similarly, the file <code class="highlighter-rouge">Item.c</code> contains an implementation for items;
normally, this would be done simply as a set of macros, but we have used
functions for some of the operations to create entries in the profile.</p>

<h4 id="c-completing-hash_table_stats">c) Completing <code class="highlighter-rouge">hash_table_stats</code></h4>

<p>Your first task is to complete the <code class="highlighter-rouge">hash_table_stats()</code> function in
HashTable.c This function should print the following information about
the hash table:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the number of slots in the hash table array</li>
  <li>the number of items stored in the (lists of the) hash table</li>
  <li>information about the lengths of chains in a table containing
    <ul>
      <li>the length of chains (use zero length for unused array slots)</li>
      <li>the number (frequency) of chains with this length</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The table should have a row for each chain length from 0 up to the
maximum chain length.
Note that you’ll need to work out the maximum chain length, and then
allocate an array of counters of the appropriate size.</p>

<h5 id="output"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Output</code></h5>

<p>When functioning correctly, the program should behave as follows:</p>

<pre>
<kbd is="shell">./mkwords 2000 13 &gt; wordsfile</kbd>
<kbd is="shell">./words2 wordsfile 1777</kbd>
Reading words from wordsfile
Hash Table Stats:
Number of slots = 1777
Number of items = 1970
Chain length distribution
  Length  #Chains
       0      585
       1      657
       2      351
       3      139
       4       33
       5       11
       7        1
</pre>

<h5 id="more-output">More output</h5>

<p>Note that you could produce the same output, without needing an intermediate file, using the command:</p>

<pre>
<kbd is="shell">./mkwords 2000 13 | ./words2 - 1777</kbd>
</pre>

<p>The above commands insert 2000 words (1970 distinct words) into a hash
table with 1777 slots.
The output tells us that there are 585 unused slots in the hash table
(chain length 0), and 657 slots with chains of length 1, etc.</p>

<h5 id="chain-length">Chain length</h5>

<p>If there are no chains of a given length, then nothing is written for
that length, e.g.</p>

<pre>
<kbd is="shell">./mkwords 1000 7 | ./words2 - 101</kbd>
Reading words from stdin
Hash Table Stats:
Number of slots = 101
Number of items = 991
Chain length distribution
  Length  #Chains
       2        1
       4        2
       5        2
       6        6
       7       16
       8       12
       9       13
      10       15
      11        8
      12        6
      13        5
      14        5
      15        3
      16        3
      17        1
      18        2
      19        1
</pre>

<p>This output is for a small hash table with just 101 slots.
Since there is no entry for 0, all of the slots in the hash tables have
been used (i.e. no slots with zero items).</p>

<p>Since there are no entries for 1 and 3, this tells us there are no
chains of length 1 or 3; this is not in itself interesting, and is just
way that it works out for this data.</p>

<h5 id="overflow-chains">Overflow chains</h5>

<p>Many of the slots have overflow chains of length 10; hits on any of
these hash table entries will result in us examining up to 10 items. We
can also see that the longest chain contains 19 items.</p>

<p>Ideally, we would like each chain to contain a small number of items;
this means that the hash table needs to have a number of slots that is
proportional to the number of items (e.g. if the has function works
perfectly and we have n items and n/3 slots, we’d expect each chain to
be of length ~3).</p>

<p>Note: Our implementation does not allow duplicates to be inserted into
the hashtable</p>

<!-- =============================================================== -->
<h2 id="exercise-4">
  Exercise 4: HashTable Analysis
  <small class="text-muted text-nowrap">(1 mark)</small></h2>

<h3 id="background-execution-profiling">Background: Execution Profiling</h3>

<p>Execution profilers measure statistics like the number of times each
function is called and the average time spent executing each function,
in order to identify which functions are contributing most to the cost
of executing the program.
Raw timing data (e.g. using the time command) gives you an overview of
how fast a program is, but an execution profile gives you detailed
information about <em>where</em> it’s spending all of its time, and thus where
you should focus any attempts at improving its performance.</p>

<p>The standard execution profiler on Linux is <code class="highlighter-rouge">gprof</code>. In order to profile
a C program, the program needs to be compiled and linked with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-pg</code>
flag.
When you compiled the <code class="highlighter-rouge">words</code> program with <code class="highlighter-rouge">make</code> earlier, you may have
noticed that <code class="highlighter-rouge">-pg</code> appeared on each line with <code class="highlighter-rouge">3c</code>.</p>

<p>Programs compiled with <code class="highlighter-rouge">-pg</code> include additional code that monitors the
execution of the program and measures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>overall execution time</li>
  <li>how many times each function is called</li>
  <li>which functions call which other functions</li>
  <li>how much time it takes to execute each function</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="generating-an-execution-profile-using-gprof">Generating an execution profile using <code class="highlighter-rouge">gprof</code></h4>

<p>To generate an execution profile, run e.g. the following two commands:</p>

<pre>
<kbd is="shell">./mkwords 100000 3 | ./words2 - 50033</kbd>
....
<kbd is="shell">gprof words2 | less</kbd>
</pre>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">mkwords</code> program outputs 100000 words, and passes them to the words
program which inserts them into a hash table with 50033 slots.
Since <code class="highlighter-rouge">mkwords</code> may produce duplicates when generating large numbers of
words, the actual number of distinct words added to the hash table may
be less than the number of words requested (in this case, 90893 distinct
items will be inserted).</p>

<p>Remember that for each word in the input, there will be one insert
operation (to add it to the hash table) and one search operation (to
check that it was added).</p>

<p>Since <code class="highlighter-rouge">gprof</code> produces quite a lot of output, it is useful to pipe it
through the <code class="highlighter-rouge">less</code> command, which allows us to scroll through output one
screenful at a time.</p>

<h4 id="output-from-gprof">Output from <code class="highlighter-rouge">gprof</code></h4>

<p>The output from <code class="highlighter-rouge">gprof</code> has two parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>flat profile: how much time was spent in each funtion; how many
times it was called</li>
  <li>graph profile: how many times was each function called from which
other functions</li>
</ul>

<p>For this lab, we consider only the flat profile, although you might want
to check the graph profile to see if it gives you any information that
might be useful to tune the program.</p>

<p>If you execute the <code class="highlighter-rouge">words</code> program as above, then the flat profile will
look approximately like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Flat profile:

<h4 id="output-variance">Output variance</h4>

<p>Warning: Note that, for the same input, the counts of function calls
should be consistent across all machines, and you should be able to
explain (from looking at the code) where the counts come from.</p>

<p>However, the timing (being sampling-based) may differ from machine to
machine, and even differ between executions of the program on the same
machine.  This may result in significantly different times, different
percentages, and even a different ordering of functions.</p>

<p>Given such variations, is this kind of profile even useful?
Yes, because the most time-consuming functions will be consistently
higher than all of the others, and thus give you a basis for tuning.</p>

<h4 id="understanding-the-output">Understanding the output</h4>

<p>Each line gives some statistics for one function in the program.
The “% time” column indicates the percentage of execution time that was
spent in the function.
The (approximate) total running time of the program can be obtained by
reading down the “cumulative seconds” column; the final value is the
total time.
The “self seconds” column gives the total time spent executing that
function, during the entire course of program execution; the values in
this column are added to obtain the “cumulative seconds” column.
The “calls” column indicates the total number of times that the function
was called during program execution.
The “self ms/call” gives the average time spent in each call of the
function, while the “total ms/call” gives the time spent in this
function plus any of the functions it calls.</p>

<p>In the above profile, you can see that the program takes a total of 0.04
seconds to run (the last value in the “cumulative seconds” column).</p>

<p>Function-wise, most of the time is spent in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">hash()</code> function.
(However, as noted above, you may observe different functions and quite
different percentages.)</p>

<h4 id="improving-performance">Improving performance</h4>

<p>You might be surprised to see that most of the functions appear to cost
0.00ms to run.
The most likely explanation here is that the cost of executing the
function is, on average, less than 0.005 ms, which is rounded down to
zero.</p>

<p>Such a small cost may mean that the function itself is not inherently
inefficient; if it features prominently in the cumulative time, you need
to consider why it’s being called so many times (which is where the
graph profile helps).</p>

<p>In the above example, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">hash()</code> function is called many times, but
can’t be called less times (why not?), so if we want to tune the
performance of this program, we would need to improve the speed of the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">hash()</code> function (but without sacrificing its good performance in
spreading hash values across the index range).</p>

<p>If we make the hashing distribution worse while making the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">hash()</code> function faster, we might simply end up moving the cost from the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">hash()</code> function to some other function such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">list_search()</code>.</p>

<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>

<p>For testing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">words2</code> program, you will want to use some reasonably
large inputs. Try running your program as follows:</p>

<pre><kbd is="shell">./mkwords 1000000 | ./words2 - 424247</kbd></pre>

<p>Note that the above command inserts 857424 distinct words into a hash
table with 424247 slots.
Clearly, since there are more words than slots, chains of length greater
than one will occur frequently in this table.
You could try adding more slots to the table to see how this improves
the average/maximum chain length.
You could also try inserting more words, to do some serious stress
testing.
We suggest keeping the ratio of words to slots at less than 2:1, and
ideally closer to 1:1 (which is aiming at one slot per word).</p>

<p>Remember that the whole point of minimising chain lengths is that the
worst case lookup cost is proportional to the maximum chain length, and
the average case cost is proportional to the average chain length.</p>

<p>You will quickly notice, while running with large inputs, that different
slot numbers produce different average chain lengths, and those examples
with shorter average chain lengths run much faster than those with
longer average chain lengths.</p>

<p>If you want an alternative word set, there is a dictionary of 90,000
English words and a dictionary of 5 million place names (from the
GeoNames database) which you could use on the CSE workstations.</p>

<p>Try the following commands:</p>

<pre>
<kbd is="shell">./words2 /web/cs2521/19t0/week08/lab/dict 49999</kbd>
<kbd is="shell">./words2 /web/cs2521/19t0/week08/lab/dict 50000</kbd>
<kbd is="shell">./words2 /web/cs2521/19t0/week08/lab/places 1048576</kbd>
<kbd is="shell">./words2 /web/cs2521/19t0/week08/lab/places 1048573</kbd>
</pre>

<p>Don’t copy these files to your own directory as they are quite large.</p>

<h4 id="discussion-questions">Discussion questions</h4>

<p>Consider the questions below, using the above command and variations on
it (see below).</p>

<p>Put your answers in a text file called lab08.txt.</p>

<p>Your answers file should (ultimately) contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>answers to the questions below</li>
  <li>output from words2 to illustrate your answers (where appropriate)</li>
  <li>flat profiles to illustrate your answers (where appropriate)
analyses/explanations for all answers</li>
</ul>

<p>The precise format of the answers file is not important.
What is important is that you explain your answers, using relevant
evidence from both the from the profile output and the output of the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">words</code> program.</p>

<ol type="alpha">
<li>

The <tt>mkwords 1000000 3</tt> command produces 857424 distinct words.

<ul>
<li> What is the maximum chain length if a hash table size of 85711 is used?</li>
<li>How does the chain length distribution change if the hash table size
   is 100000? 214283? 400000? 400837? 857144? 857137?</li>
</ul>

</li>

<li>
Every other number above (i.e. 85711, 214283, 400837, 857137) is prime.
It is often noted that using prime numbers appropriately in the hash
function leads to a better distribution of hash values, and thus
generally shorter chains.

Does this appear to be the case for the hash table sizes in the previous
question?
</li>

<li>
An "optimal" hash table would have all slots occupied and have all
chains of length roughly (nwords/nslots).

In practice, this is impossible to achieve in the general case, and what
we want is a table with relatively short chains, with as few slots as
possible (small size of hash table), and not too many empty slots.

Can you find a suitable hash table size that keeps the maximum chain
length under 10, and has most chains with length 1 or 2, but also
uses more than 2/3 of the slots?
</li>

<li>
Compare both the outputs and the profiles for the two commands:

<kbd is="shell">./words2 /web/cs2521/19t0/week08/lab/places 1048576</kbd>
<kbd is="shell">./words2 /web/cs2521/19t0/week08/lab/places 1048573</kbd>
</pre>

What does this tell you about hash table search performance when the
hash function is significantly sub-optimal?
</li>


<li>
Examine the profiles from running the command:

<pre><kbd is="shell">./mkwords 1000000 | ./words2 - N</kbd></pre>

for a number of different values of N.

What are the most costly functions
(in terms of overall time)?
</li>

<li>
How could the individual functions be improved?

How could the overall performance be improved?
</li>

<li>
Implement your suggestions and then give a new profile to show the
improvement, and explain how the profile shows the improvement.

<h2 id="exercise-5">
  Bonus: Search in a Splay Tree
  <small class="text-muted text-nowrap">(1 mark)</small></h2>

<p>In lectures, we discussed
inserting an item into a splay tree
(balanced tree examples).
The amortised cost of insert and search operations
on splay trees is only valid
if we also perform splay rotations
during searching for an item.
An partial of implementation
of <code class="highlighter-rouge">btree_search_splay</code>
has been provided in <code class="highlighter-rouge">btree.c</code>
to get you started.
Its prototype is as follows:</p>

<div class="language-c highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">static</span> <span class="n">tree_node</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">search_splay</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tree_node</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">n</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Key</span> <span class="n">k</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">bool</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">found</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It searches for an item and performs splay rotations on the traversed
path, much like the function <code class="highlighter-rouge">insert_splay()</code> does.</p>

<p>NOTE:
once an item has been found,
it is moved to the root of tree.
If the key does not exist in the tree,
the last node on the search path
should be moved to the root.</p>

<p>You can look at <code class="highlighter-rouge">insert_splay()</code>
to help you implement this function.</p>

<p>NOTE:
because the search function
changes the root of the tree, 
it needs to return a pointer to the new root,
so the actual result of the search
should be stored in 
the variable pointed to by found. 
This should be <code class="highlighter-rouge">true</code> 
if the key was in the tree 
and <code class="highlighter-rouge">false</code> otherwise.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">tree_search</code> function
needs to be modified
so that it calls the appropriate version of seach,
depending what balancing strategy is used:
if the balance strategy is <code class="highlighter-rouge">SPLAY</code>,
it uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">search_splay</code>,
or the standard searchRecursive otherwise.</p>

<p>Devise and run some experiments
to compare your splay tree
to the previous splay tree
that only performed splay operations on insertion.
Write it up in your lab08.txt file.</p>

<p>If you have time,
try to factor the common splay logic
out of <code class="highlighter-rouge">insert_splay</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">search_splay</code>.</p>
