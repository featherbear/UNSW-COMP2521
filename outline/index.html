      <h2>Course Summary</h2>
    </header>

    <p>The goal of this course is
to deepen your understanding of
data structures and algorithms
and how these can be employed effectively
in the design of software systems.
It is an important course in covering
a range of core data structures and algorithms
that will be used in context in later courses.
You explore these ideas in
lectures, tutorials, lab classes, and assignments.
Assessment involves practical lab exercises,
assignments, and practical and theory exams.
At the end of the course,
we want you to be a solid programmer,
with knowledge of a range of
useful data structures and programming techniques,
capable of building significant software systems
in a team environment,
and ready to continue with
further specialised studies in computing.</p>

    <p><strong>Topics:</strong>
An introduction to
the structure, analysis and usage of
a range of fundamental data types
and the core algorithms that operate on them,
including:
algorithm analysis, sorting, searching, trees,
graphs, files, algorithmic strategies,
analysis and measurement of programs.
Labs and programming assignments in C,
using a range of Unix tools.</p>

      <h2>Course Aims</h2>
    </header>

    <p>The aim of this course is
to get you to <strong>think like a computer scientist</strong>.
This certainly sounds like a noble goal…
but what does it really mean?
How does a <em>scientist</em>,
let alone a computer scientist,
actually think?</p>

    <p>What many types of scientists try to do
is understand natural systems and processes:
a geologist, for example,
tries to understand the structure of the earth;
a biologist tries to understand living organisms;
a chemist tries to understand materials and reactions,
and so on.</p>

    <p>Computer scientists don’t,
as the name might suggest,
simply try to understand
the structure and behaviour of computers,
but are more concerned with
understanding software systems
(and the interaction between
the software and the hardware on which it runs).
Also, unlike other scientists,
computer scientists frequently build
the objects that they study.</p>

    <p>During this course, we’ll be looking at
ways of creating, analysing and understanding software.
Ultimately, you should be able to answer the question,
<strong>“is this piece of software any good?”</strong>
and be able to provide sound reasons to justify your answer.</p>

    <p>This course follows on from introductory C programming courses:
COMP1511, COMP1917, or COMP1921.
We cover additional aspects of the C programming language
that were not covered in those courses,
and also look at some programming tools
which were not covered (in detail) earlier.
However, this course is not simply
a second C programming course:
the focus is on the ideas and abstractions
behind the data structures and algorithms that are used.</p>

    <p>COMP2521 is a critical course
in the study of computing at UNSW,
since it deals with many concepts that are
central to future studies in the area.
Whether you are studying Computer Science,
Software Engineering, Bioinformatics,
Computer Engineering,
or even a discipline outside the realm of computing,
understanding a range of algorithms and data structures
and how to use them
will make you a much more effective
computing problem solver in the future.</p>

      <h2>Assumed Knowledge</h2>
    </header>

    <p>The official pre-requisite for this course is
either COMP1511 <em>or</em> COMP1917 <em>or</em> COMP1921.</p>

    <p>Whether or not you satisfy the pre-requisite,
we assume that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>you can program in the C programming language,
and are familiar with arrays, strings, pointers,
dynamic memory allocation, recursion;</li>
      <li>you are able to design, implement,
debug, test and document small C programs
(up to several hundred lines of code); and</li>
      <li>you are familiar with
the Linux environment on CSE computers.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Installing Linux, possibly as a virtual machine,
on your own computer would be a major bonus.</p>

      <h2>Teaching Rationale and Strategies</h2>
    </header>

    <p>Computer Science is, to a large extent, a practical discipline,
and so COMP2521 has a large emphasis on practice.
We uses the standard set of practice-focussed teaching strategies
employed by most CSE foundational courses:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>lectures</strong> introduce concepts and demonstrate examples;</li>
      <li><strong>tutorials</strong> reinforce concepts and provide additional examples;</li>
      <li><strong>lab exercises</strong> provide examples of using various technologies; and</li>
      <li><strong>assignments</strong> allow you to solve larger problems;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The only way to develop the skills
to do effective software development is by practising them.
If you slack off on the assignments and lab exercises
(or, worse, rely on someone else to do them for you),
you’re wasting the course’s most valuable learning opportunities.</p>

    <h3 id="lectures">Lectures</h3>

    <p>Lectures aim to convey
basic information about the course content
and to model the practices and techniques involved
in software development,
including demonstrations and exercises
where we examine the practice of
developing and analysing programs.</p>

    <p>Each week, there will be five hours of lectures
during which theory, practical demonstrations
and case-studies will be presented.
Lectures convey a small amount of information
about the course content,
but their main aim is to try to stimulate you
to think about concepts and techniques.
Feel free to ask questions at any stage,
but otherwise please respect
people around you who are trying to listen
and (<em>shhhhhh!</em>) keep quiet.</p>

    <h3 id="tutorials">Tutorials</h3>

    <p>The most important components of the course,
however, are the tutorials, labs and assignments.</p>

    <p>Tutorials aim to clarify and refine the knowledge
that you got from lectures,
and from reading the text book and notes,
and to develop analysis and understanding
via practical case studies.</p>

    <p>There will be a number of exercises
set for each tutorial class;
the aim of the time is <em>not</em>
to simply get the tutor to give you the answers;
instead, focus on just one or two of the exercises,
and work through them in detail,
discussing fine details, alternative approaches, etc.
You can use the questions
that weren’t examined in as much depth, or at all,
for your own study.</p>

    <p>You must be active and ask questions in tutorials!
Ideally, students should run the entire tute themselves,
with the tutor being a moderator,
and occasionally providing additional explanations or clarifications.</p>

    <h3 id="laboratories">Laboratories</h3>

    <p>Laboratory exercises provide a venue
to put together and explore ideas,
and to practice problem solving,
program development, and analysis.</p>

    <p>Each week, there will be
several small exercises to work on,
released in the week preceding the class.
The exercises will need to be submitted,
and will be assessed by your tutor.
During the lab,
your tutor will provide feedback on
your approach to the problem,
and on style in your solution.</p>

    <p>Except for in the first week,
labs will be done in pairs,
and you and you partner
should discuss the exercises
<em>before</em> going to the lab,
to maximise the usefulness of the class.</p>

    <h3 id="assignments">Assignments</h3>

    <p>Assignments provide opportunities to work on
substantial (hundreds of lines of code) programming exercises.</p>

    <p>The first assignment is an individual assignment;
the second will be completed in groups.
We expect all members of a pair or group
to contribute to the assignments;
part of your assignment mark will be tied to this.</p>

    <p>As noted above, assignments are the primary vehicle
for learning the material in this course.
If you don’t do them,
or, worse, simply copy and submit someone else’s work,
you have wasted a valuable learning opportunity.</p>

  <section id="assessment">
    <header>
      <h2>Assessment</h2>
    </header>

    <p>The University requires us to assess
how well you have learned the course content,
and the usual primary approach is via a final exam.
An exam is the ultimate summative assessment tool;
it gives you a chance, at the end of the course,
to demonstrate everything that you’ve learned.
Labs and assignments are a <em>learning</em> tool,
not an assessment tool:
in an ideal world, I would award no marks for them;
however, to give a more concrete incentive to do them
(in a timely fashion), there are marks tied to them.</p>

      <h2>Course Resources</h2>
    </header>

    <p>COMP2521 follows the contents of the pair of books:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Algorithms in C, Parts 1-4:
<em>Fundamentals, Data Structures, Sorting, Searching</em> (3rd Edition)
by Robert Sedgewick, Addison-Wesley</li>
      <li>Algorithms in C, Part 5: <em>Graph Algorithms</em> (3rd Edition)
by Robert Sedgewick, Addison-Wesley</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These two books are available
as a bundle from the UNSW bookshop.
They are expensive,
but are useful well beyond this course,
and will serve as a useful reference
on the bookshelf of any serious programmer,
despite their horrific style.</p>

    <p>You may also be able to find
on-line resources related to the text books.
Robert Sedgewick has a series of videos
on the topics in this course,
but unfortunately they all seem to be in Java
(which he has used for the new edition of his book).
If you find any useful on-line resources, let us know;
we’ll add them to the <em>Resources</em> section
of the course web site (with credit to the finder).</p>

    <p>This website also has links to auxiliary material/documentation
that you’ll need for the course.
Solutions for all tutorial questions and lab exercises
will also be made available.
I’ll review assignment and exam solutions in the lectures.</p>

      <h2>Academic Conduct and Integrity</h2>
    </header>

    <h3 id="student-conduct">Student Conduct</h3>

    <p>The <strong>Student Code of Conduct</strong>
(<a href="https://student.unsw.edu.au/conduct">information</a>, <a href="https://www.gs.unsw.edu.au/policy/documents/studentcodepolicy.pdf">policy</a>)
sets out what the University expects from students
as members of the UNSW community.
As well as the learning, teaching, and research environment,
the University aims to provide
an environment that enables students
to achieve their full potential
and to provide an experience consistent with
the University’s values and guiding principles.
A condition of enrolment is that
students <em>inform themselves</em> of
the University’s rules and policies affecting them,
and conduct themselves accordingly.</p>

    <p>In particular,
students have the responsibility
to observe standards of equity and respect
in dealing with every member of the University community.
This applies to all activities on UNSW premises,
and all external activities related to study and research.
This includes behaviour in person,
as well as behaviour on social media,
for example Facebook groups set up
for the purpose of discussing UNSW courses or course work.</p>

    <p>Behaviour that is considered in breach of
the Student Code Policy as discriminatory,
sexually inappropriate, bullying, harassing,
invading another’s privacy or
causing any person to fear for their personal safety
is serious misconduct and can lead to severe penalties,
up to and including suspension or exclusion from UNSW.</p>

    <p>If you have any concerns, you may raise them with your
lecturer, or approach the
<a href="ethics-officer@cse.unsw.edu.au">School Ethics Officer</a>,
<a href="grievance-officer@cse.unsw.edu.au">Grievance Officer</a>,
or one of the student representatives.</p>

    <h3 id="academic-honesty-and-plagiarism">Academic Honesty and Plagiarism</h3>

    <p><strong>Plagiarism</strong> is <a href="https://student.unsw.edu.au/plagiarism">defined as</a>
using the words or ideas of others,
and presenting them as your own.
UNSW and CSE treat plagiarism as academic misconduct,
which means that it carries penalties
up to and including being excluded from further study at UNSW.
There are several on-line sources to help you understand
what plagiarism is and how it is dealt with at UNSW:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://student.unsw.edu.au/plagiarism">Plagiarism and Academic Integrity</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://www.gs.unsw.edu.au/policy/documents/plagiarismprocedure.pdf">UNSW Plagiarism Procedure</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Please take the time to read and understand these documents.
Ignorance is not accepted as an excuse for plagiarism.
In particular, you are responsible for the safe-keeping
of your assignment files such that they are
not accessible by anyone but you by setting proper permissions
on your CSE home directory and/or on online code repositories.</p>

    <p>Note also that plagiarism includes
paying or asking another person to do a piece of work for you
and then submitting it as your own work.</p>

    <p>UNSW has an ongoing commitment to fostering
a culture of learning informed by academic integrity.
All UNSW staff and students have a responsibility
to adhere to this principle of academic integrity.
Plagiarism undermines academic integrity,
and is not tolerated at UNSW.</p>
